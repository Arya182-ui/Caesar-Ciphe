# 🔒 Caesar Cipher Tool

A powerful, user-friendly GUI-based application for encrypting, decrypting, and visualizing text using the Caesar Cipher technique. Built with **Python** and **Tkinter**, it includes frequency analysis and logging features to enhance security and usability.

---

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Encryption & Decryption**: Easily encrypt and decrypt text with a shift value.  
✅ **Frequency Visualization**: Plot character frequency for text analysis.  
✅ **File Operations**: Open, encrypt, decrypt, and save files seamlessly.  
✅ **Logging**: Records every operation with timestamps for auditing.  
✅ **Brute Force Decryption**: Crack the cipher without knowing the shift.
